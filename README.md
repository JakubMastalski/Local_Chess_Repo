A C++ program that implements a chess game, allowing two players to play chess on a virtual board.
The program supports the basic rules of chess, including piece movement, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
It is designed to handle player input, check the legality of moves, and update the board accordingly.
The game also checks for special conditions such as check, checkmate, and stalemate.
